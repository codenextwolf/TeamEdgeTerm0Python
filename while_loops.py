 #  Team Edge Mini-project: WHILE LOOP CHALLENGES
 # 
 #   Complete the following loop challenges below. Follow the ToDos
 #   1. IN YOUR PRIME: Declare a while loop that prints all the prime 
 #      numbers between 0 and 100 (use the helper function provided)
 #   2. FOUND: use a while loop to search the contents of a list for
 #     the key!
 #   3. BUGGIN: Find out why these while loops don't do what they say 
 #     they do.
 #   4. MATH QUIZ: Prompt a user to solve a random math problem, if 
 #      they get it right, say congrats, if not, keep prompting.
 #   5. WHAT AM I: Write a game loop that prompts that never stops
 #      asking, "Iknow you are a _____, but what am I?"
 #
